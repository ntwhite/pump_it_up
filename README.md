drivendata competition

This repo contains a submission for this drivendata competition:  https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/

AIM consulting partnered with DrivenData to host a half-day hackathon for local college students in February 2020.  https://aimconsulting.com/i-%E2%9D%A4-data-hackathon/

To test the feasibility of the platform and create an example presentation for the students, I executed my own model and created a very simple slide deck.  The submission results were in the top 9% of submissions back in february, but since then other teams have caught up and my submission score has slipped to the top 17% of all submissions.
